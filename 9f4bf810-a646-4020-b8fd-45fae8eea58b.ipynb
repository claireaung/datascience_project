    "Not all missing values affect the research: the single missing value in `'title'` is not critical. The missing values in columns `'imdb_score'` and `'imdb_votes'` represent around 6% of all records (4,609 and 4,726, respectively, of the total 85,579). This could potentially affect our research. To avoid this issue, we will drop rows with missing values in the `'imdb_score'` and `'imdb_votes'` columns."
